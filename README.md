#Password Generator

## Description

I was given the task to write the JavaScript for a password generator. Password generators are used to make passwords out of random letters, numbers, and characters. This makes them much more secure since they are harder to guess. The password generator would not work without JavaScript. JavaScript is what makes webpages interactive. It is responsible for pop-up menus, animations, clickable buttons, among many other dynamic elements of webpages. I built this project so I could better unerstand how to use JavaScript, and how HTML and CSS work along with it to create dynamic, responsive webpages.

## Usage

Once you navigate to the password generator page you will see a red button that says, "Generate Password". Upon clicking this button you will receive several prompts regarding the password criteria you are requesting. You will be asked how many characters you would like your password to be, if you would like capital letters, lower case letters, special characters and/or numbers. Once answering these questions your newly generated password will appear in the box.
